  ## AI Liability Directive's Impact on Product Management in the Maritime Industry

  **The AI Liability Directive (AILD) is poised to significantly impact product management in the maritime industry by introducing harmonized rules for non-contractual liability related to AI systems, which will necessitate substantial compliance efforts from organizations.** The directive, proposed by the European Commission on September 28, 2022, aims to address the complexities of AI-related damages by establishing a framework that complements existing national liability laws. This initiative is part of a broader regulatory effort that includes the AI Act and the revised Product Liability Directive (PLD), both of which are integral to the EU's strategy for managing AI risks.

  ### Core Points of the AI Liability Directive

  The AILD introduces two key legal tools to aid individuals harmed by AI systems:
  1. **Disclosure of Evidence**: This provision addresses the "black box" nature of AI systems by allowing claimants to request disclosure of relevant information from AI operators. This is crucial for identifying potential claims and liable parties.
  2. **Rebuttable Presumption of Causality**: If an AI provider fails to comply with applicable duties of care, and the AI system's output causes damage, the directive presumes a causal link between the breach and the damage.

  ### Effects on Maritime Products

  In the maritime industry, AI systems are increasingly used for navigation, vessel management, and predictive maintenance. The AILD's requirements mean that maritime product managers must ensure that AI systems comply with safety and transparency standards. For instance, if an AI system used for navigation fails and causes a collision, the directive could facilitate claims against the system's provider by presuming causality if compliance lapses are proven.

  ### Organizational Compliance Needs

  Organizations in the maritime sector must:
  - Implement robust documentation and transparency practices for AI systems.
  - Ensure compliance with the AI Act's safety and data governance requirements.
  - Prepare for potential disclosure requests by maintaining detailed records of AI system operations and decision-making processes.

  ### Possible Penalties for Non-Compliance

  Non-compliance with the AILD can lead to significant legal and financial repercussions. While the directive itself does not specify penalties, it aligns with the AI Act, which imposes fines up to €35 million or 7% of a company's total worldwide annual turnover for severe breaches. This underscores the importance of adhering to the directive's requirements to avoid substantial liabilities.

  ### Compliance Deadlines

  The AILD is still under legislative consideration, with discussions expected to continue into 2024. Once adopted, member states will have a two-year period to transpose the directive into national law. Organizations should anticipate compliance requirements becoming enforceable by mid-2026.

  ### Next Steps for Compliance

  Maritime companies should take proactive steps to align with the AILD:
  - Conduct comprehensive risk assessments of AI systems to identify potential compliance gaps.
  - Develop and implement training programs to enhance AI literacy among staff.
  - Establish a cross-functional compliance team to oversee adherence to the directive and related regulations.
